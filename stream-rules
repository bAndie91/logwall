# Note. You can use only process-level testing keywords and 'action' keyword here:
# realpid, puid, pgid, powner, pgroup, exe, comm, args, uid, gid, owner, group, fifonick, action
# Testing message-level attributes (eg. facility, severity, msg), rewrites, and 'tee' action results in undefined behavior.
# Extra rewrites works only here:
#   terminator - set syslog datagram terminator char (normally \x00 on sockets, \x0A on FIFOs)
